The Costa Rican electricity system consists mainly of the Instituto Costarricense de electricidad (ICE) (a [[SOE]]), the Compañía nacional de fuerza y luz with ICE being practically it's only owner, two municipal companies and a few other rural electricity [[cooperativas|cooperatives]], with these last one s being supported by ice and all running power through ICE owned infraestructure, til now ice has been able to provide for the growing energy needs of Costa Rican nation despite political limitations given to it, with a enviable record of providing 99% electrification from 14% at its foundation at 1949, it's a big ass example of how [[state ownership is alright ]]
