farmers have to sell before their produce spoil, this limited window of business opportunity makes it easy for supermarkets and other food buyers to get fast deals from them as they have no other choice or they lose everything as [[steinman-2019]] (page 121 )aptly puts it " leaving growers with little to no power to dictate terms to the mere handful of grocery gatekeepers available to buy their product" this is especifically relevant to highly perishable goods, (like [[steinman-2019]] mentions: vegetables) this all being a clear example of the concept that [[grocery-giants-market-power-gives-them-control-over-producer-and-consumer-prices]],reminding me of the fact that [[farming is a profession highly sensitive to financial disruption]] and that [[farmers will have to accept cheaper prices or lose everything]] and be in debt for inmense amounts of money, which is [[how every farming season is financed]].
this all means that [[farmers alone are rarely able to compete fairly]].
