the united kingdom healthcare is the beveridge system, which in part means that they are a "integrated system of publically owned hospitals" as [[James Medlock]] says in his interview in the nordic model substack, this is better costwise then the quasi private system of canada, in which hospitals are owned by private hands, and even better then the bismarckian model in germany, in which public and private insurers compete, the best tho is [[the danish model of healthcare]], which is public in its entirety and has manqaged to offer "free on the point of care" service, with excellent coverage minimun wait times, and "minimal share of the gdp in healthcare" [[James Medlock]] calls it [[“equality of the highest standards, not an equality of minimal needs.”]], as succesful social democratics models try their welfare states to be compared to the other nations of europe tho is higher then the uk on that last point i find this amazing as the european countries healthcare systems are recognized to be the bests in the world in general, does this means that one of the "best of the best" in quality healthcares comes from [[the nordic countries]] and in a completely public and socialized manner?, this is a important question because the main criticism of public healthcare is quality of service in [[latin america]]
