supermarkets and other parts of the logistic chain of food are know to have huge market power over the producers of the foodstuffs we consume, as this system can be conceived as a zero zum game, in which the more consolidated the control of the chains and their logistic subparts (be it autonomous companies or not) over the food industry as a whole the less power does a farmer has over the prices of food they sell their wares in to them and ultimately the consumer, the rules of olygopsony are relevant directly, this also gives this "grocery giants" as [[steinman-2019]] puts it, this also means a ability to set higher consumer prices of course.  this is all compounded by the fact that [[farming is a profession highly sensitive to financial disruption]], among other things live the concept that [[farmers live on a timer related with their p+roduce]] thus putting them uniquely at the mercy of the "olygopsonies" (page 62)
